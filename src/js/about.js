            The first monastery in the United States to be established by
            followers of Ajahn Chah, Abhayagiri was founded in 1996 in the
            mountainous forests of Mendocino County, California. The origins
            of the monastery can be traced to Northern California visits in
            the early 1980s by Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Chah's senior western
            disciple. In 1995, Venerable Master Hs√ºan Hua, the founding
            abbot of The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB) in Ukiah,
            offered 120 acres of CTTB-owned forested property in Redwood
            Valley. The first residents of Abhayagiri arrived June 1, 1996.
